For web development 3 languages are paramount:
    HTML: for content only
    CSS: style
    JavaScript: behavior

HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
It is the structure of the website.

Elements:
    There are various html elements available to us to define the structure of
    the website. Elements or tags may be self-closing or may require closing
    tag.
Attributes:
    Attributes are written inside starting tags to personalize the elements
    according to our needs.
    eg. <hr size=3>

Boilerplate:
    The Boilerplate can be accessed just be writing ht and press center
    in the atom editor after package installation.

header: contains info, including title, all the meta data, viewport info
        and the links which allow to link css files with the html code

        link is a self-closing tag and is mostly used inside head element, and is
        used to link CSS files,
                frameworks and libraries using CDN
                favicon, where rel="icon"
