            Check 7form.html for example

<form>
The <form> HTML element represents a document section containing interactive
controls for submitting information.

<!-- Form which will send a GET request to the current URL -->
<form>
  <label>Name:
    <input name="submitted-name" autocomplete="name">
  </label>
  <button>Save</button>
</form>

The method attribute specifies how to send form-data
(the form-data is sent to the page specified in the action attribute).

The form-data can be sent as
    URL variables (with method="get")
    or
    as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

Notes on GET:
Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:
Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown in URL)
Has no size limitations
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
