<a>: The Anchor element

The <a> (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to
web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else
a URL can address.
Content within each <a> should indicate the link's
destination.
If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while
focused on the <a> element will activate it.

eg.
    <a href="https://example.com">Go to Website</a>

    instead of text="Go to Website" can use anything, even images.

we can even go to an object to a page, by adding id name in the href attribute,
like href = "#id_name_ofElementYouWantToMoveTo"

it also has another attribute called target

target: decides where to display the link when it is clicked.
_blank	Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self	Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent	Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top	Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename	Opens the linked document in the named iframe
