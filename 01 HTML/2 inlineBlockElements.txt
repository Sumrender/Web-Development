elements either have inline or block orientation.

for example: h1 to h6, p tags are block elements, i.e. they take
all the width of their row.

Whereas inline elements like anchor and image tag only take as much width as
required.

If you see inline elements on a new line, then it should be due to then
block elements above or below them.
