API stands for Application Programming Interfaces and is program or code
made to CREATE SOFTWARE(ex: jQuery) or INTERACT with EXTERNAL systems.

  API has:
> Endpoint         = starting url of api
> Paths            = further branching ex: (api.student.com/IT) student is endpoint and IT is path 
> Parameters       = for custom queries, in which key:value pair are passed as parameters in the API (api.student.com/Comp?age=19&score=9)
> Authentication

Made the foolish mistake of the century:
  tried to run the web app using live server.
fool we have allotted port 3000 and made our own server, should have simply used 
      localhost:3000
