res.send(); // can only be sent once in the get request.

res.write(); // can be used to send multiple pieces of html.

html file is passed using:
res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");

// for its css and other static files we have to use 
app.use(express.static("public"));
//where public is the name of folder and is considered root so in html
// can directly link by "/style.css"
