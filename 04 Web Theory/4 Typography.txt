Fonts always matter.

serif has feet 
- used to make text serious, imp, authoritative

as we move towards modern serif types the diff. b/w thin and thick contrast increases.

sans-serif
- without feet

use around 2 fonts on your site
use similar fonts
use contrasting font-types in heading and sub-heading as it makes it more interesting
and use diff bold to highlight it.
