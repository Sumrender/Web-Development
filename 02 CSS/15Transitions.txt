How to Use CSS Transitions?
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

the CSS property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect
Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

.greenbox{background-color: #31af37; 
    height: 100px; 
    width: 100px; 
    transition: width 1s, height 1s, otherProperty time;
}
.greenbox:hover{ 
    width: 300px; 
    height: 300px;
}
