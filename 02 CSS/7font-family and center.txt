center text in divisions both vertically and horizontally :
for horizontal: do text-align: center;
for vertical: you can use css positioning


center can be done by text-align property in body.
************************************************
for other elements like div use the following property:
              margin: 0 auto;

text:
  we use font-family property.
  there is option of fallback if the current font is not installed on visitor pc.
  eg. body {
              font-family: Impact, Arial, Serif;
            }
first pc will try to render Impact font. If that is not available then it will
fallback to arial font. Both of these will be in Serif style.

font embedding:
  just use the font you like, but add a link in the head section which goes to
  the link. eg. fonts.google.com

font-size is commonly set using em instead of px.
                                                                ------------------1 em = 16 px----------
    but important factor is that it is dynamic i.e. it changes if
    acc. to user-defined text settings of browser.
