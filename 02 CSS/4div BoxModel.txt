The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag!

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.

CSS box model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
