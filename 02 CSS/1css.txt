CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

point to note: even without using CSS ourselves, browser has some
default css effects applied.

eg. <hr> tag, as even after changing color there
seems to be no change in the horizontal rule.

many developers use, reset css files, which forcibly changes all browser CSS
to null, so that the browser displays all the elements as developer intended
with no change from browser

PRIORITY ORDER of CSS: INLINE > INTERNAL = EXTERNAL
for internal and external, it depends which is more below one another
if internal is above link css tag, then
    i) internal tag; changes color;
    ii) but link external css file overrides the changes

Inline CSS:
eg. <body style="background-color: yellow;">
following the above example, we can make changes Inline

Internal CSS:
This piece of code is added between the two head tags.
<head>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color:#EAF6F6;
      }
      hr {
        background-color: blue;
        border-style:dotted;
        height: 3px;
        width: 40%;
      }
    </style>
</head>

External CSS:
to add external css, we need to creat link tag inside head element.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="master.css">
