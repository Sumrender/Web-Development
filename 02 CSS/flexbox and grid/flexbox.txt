Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and
small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

flex-flow ----parent-----
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which
together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default
value is row nowrap.

.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}

flex  -----child-----
This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined.
The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The
default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, it’s
like 1 0.

.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the
individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.
