The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

In HTML, the default display property value is taken from the HTML specifications
or from the browser/user default style sheet. The default value in XML is inline,
including SVG elements.

{display: none;}
{display: inline;}
{display: block;}
{display: inline-block;} // best of both worlds, can change width

______The position Property______
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static		: all html elements are static by default
relative		: moves element relative to its old position. top: 10px; means top se 10px dhakka matlab upar se niche
fixed		: it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
absolute		: moves element relative to the parent body; also removes element from flow of html
sticky		: A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met 		in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
