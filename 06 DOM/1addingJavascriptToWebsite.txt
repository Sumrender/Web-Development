Adding javascript to website

1.  inline: just enter the code inside a tag using onload keyword
            eg. <body onload="alert('hello world!')">

2. internal: using <script></script> tags and entering the code inside. 
    or
    <body onload="alert('Hello')">
    </body>

// to note when both inline and internal were present in my code and script was
    inside body element, internal code showed first and inline one later.

3. external: using src in script and entering path to .js file.

$ css link tag should be in head.
$ javascript tag should be at the bottom of the body tag, bcz if the js file is
    making changes to an html object but it is below from where I added the
    script tag, then there will be error.

DOM: Document Object Model
helps to use javascript in tandem with html.
any element has properties and methods.
eg.

Selecting elements for DOM
1. using query selector
    document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "changed h1 content"
    // only shows the first element, for all queries:
    document.querySelectorAll();
*****
    for delving deeper in query selector,
        if element is in hierarchical relation, then ("li h1");
        if element is part of main selector, then(li.className);
        // more practice required here.



2. document.getElementsByTagName("li")[0]  //gives an array of all tags use []
    // to specify which one.

3. document.getElementsByClass("")[0];
4. document.getElementByID;
